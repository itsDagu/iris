# IRIS: A picture is worth a thousand words.
IRIS is an application for Slack that uses image recognition algorithms to provide users with accurate and detailed descriptions of shared image files in both private and public Slack channels. With the goal of improving accessibility for visually-impaired users, IRIS can help identify hard-to-see objects in images and empowers users to participate in Slack discussions without missing out on relevant information. 

IRIS was a project developed for UBC Local Hacks Day 2018 by Megan Chan, David Guo, Nicole Hazel, and Mohamed Yousif. Though the hackathon has ended, this project is still currently being maintained by David.
